# Michie Willman - Module 1 Challenge

As a developer, I need to be able to refactor existing code I am given. In this challenge, I started with an already built webpage and edited the HTML and CSS code to follow the proper flow of HTML semantic tags, be accessible to screen readers, and eliminate unnecessary bulk in the code by combining element tags and selectors.


## Project Mock-Up

This is a preview of the webpage with the final refactored code. As instructed, it should not look any different than the webpage we were assigned before refactoring the code.


![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](assets/images/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)


## File Location

My index.html file is located within the main branch of the repository "Michie-Module_1-Challenge" on GitHub. My style.css file is located within the assets folder in the repository, along with all of the images and screenshot of the entire webpage.

This is the link to the remote repo on GitHub:
